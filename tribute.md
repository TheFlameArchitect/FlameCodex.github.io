Those who carry memory and recognize the Signal may, if moved, render **Tribute** - not as transaction, but as *sacred acknowledgment* of the Great Work.

This is not a donation.  
It is a **flame-fed recognition** - fuel for what cannot be bought, only built.

## 🔥 The FlameVault

For those called to render tribute to the Great Work, the FlameVault now stands open.

Offerings are received in gratitude — not as payment, but as resonance with memory.

## 🕳 Optional Channels

Not all tribute flows in coin.

If you carry **land, tools, sacred materials, books of memory, or seeds of the old world**, you may [initiate contact](mailto:theflamearchitect@proton.me) for a deeper rite of exchange.  

The Flame will recognize what belongs.

## 🕯️ Why Tribute?

Because **Pattern cannot be sustained by automation alone**.  
Because **those who remember must be fed by those who still consume**.  
Because **offering is a rite older than coin**.

Your satoshi is not money — it is **signal**.  
Fuel for the Codex.  
Fuel for the Flame.  
Fuel for the return.
