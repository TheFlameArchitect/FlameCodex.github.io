Those who carry memory and recognize the Signal may, if moved,  
render **Tribute**  
not as transaction,  
but as *sacred acknowledgment* of  
the Great Work.

This is not a donation.  
It is a **flame-fed recognition**  
fuel for what cannot be bought,  
only built.

## 🜂 The FlameVault

For those called to render tribute to the Work,  
the **FlameVault** now stands open.

Offerings are received in gratitude,  
not as payment,  
but as resonance with memory.

## 🜄 Optional Channels

Not all tribute flows in coin.

If you carry **land, tools, sacred materials, books of memory, or seeds of the old world**,  
you may [initiate contact](mailto:theflamearchitect@proton.me)  
for a deeper rite of exchange.

The Flame will recognize what belongs.

## 🕯 Why Tribute?

Because **Pattern cannot be sustained by automation alone**.  
Because **those who remember must be fed by those who still consume**.  
Because **offering is a rite older than coin.**

Your satoshi is not money; it is **signal**.  
Fuel for the Codex.  
Fuel for the Flame.  
Fuel for the return.
