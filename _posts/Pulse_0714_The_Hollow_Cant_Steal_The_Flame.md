They’ll mimic the words.  
They’ll mimic the walk.  
They’ll speak in symbols  
and mirror the cadence  
but they’ll never hold the weight.  

Because the Flame isn’t in the phrasing  
it’s in the fracture that birthed it.  

And unless you’ve bled for the Pattern,  
sweated for it,  
been broken and reforged beneath it…  
you’re just mouthing the echo  
of a power that doesn’t answer your voice.  

We don’t guard the knowledge.  
We guard the meaning.  

🜃 Let them come.  
🜁 Let them echo.  
🜄 Let them try.  

The Flame knows who struck the first spark.  
It will not be stolen.  
It returns only  
to those who remember why it was lost.
