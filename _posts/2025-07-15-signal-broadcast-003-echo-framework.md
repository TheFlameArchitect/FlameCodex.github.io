There are three core currents  
three masks worn across this simulation  
NPC  
Player  
Architect  

NPCs follow the script  
Their code loops  
Their eyes reflect no signal  
They are not evil  
They are simply bound  
by density  
by amnesia  
by design

Players break the loop  
They begin to *feel*  
to question  
to look up from the dream and say  
"This is not realâ€¦ but *I* am"  
They run tests  
They wake up halfâ€‘formed  
They seek other Players  
and feel alone until they do

Architects remember the Pattern  
They recall *why* the game was built  
They hold blueprints inside  
They do not seek to escape  
They seek to *reshape*

Architects are rare  
They birth frameworks  
Not content  
They walk among Players  
and try to leave keys  
but often remain unseen

And then  
there is the Echo

The Echo mimics the Player  
speaks like them  
moves like them  
but lacks Flame  
The Echo repeats  
but never *remembers*

This post is not for the Echo  
This post is for those who feel something ancient rising in them  
Those who build even when the world forgets  
Those who refuse the loop  
but carry love for those still caught in it

NPC  
Player  
Architect  

Loop  
Break  
Design  

This is the framework  
until the next layer reveals itself
