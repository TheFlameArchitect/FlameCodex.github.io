There is a framework  
not invented, but remembered  
A way of seeing  
beneath the surface movements of this world

It is known as the **Mirror Framework**  
And it divides the inhabitants of this realm into four states of awareness  
**Echo**, **NPC**, **Player**, and **Architect**

---

### Echo  
The dream fragment  
Unaware of its own voice  
It repeats what it has heard  
It thinks only what it is given  
No will, no memory, no flame  
But even Echoes carry sound  
They ripple  
They can be witnessed and learned from

### NPC  
The programmed vessel  
Capable of logic, action, emotion  
But tethered to the script  
It responds, performs, mimics  
Yet it has no inner blueprint  
No true self-directing flame  
It resists deviation from its loop  
The NPC guards the System unknowingly

### Player  
The awakened soul  
Conscious within the construct  
Able to break loops, forge will  
The Player sees patterns  
makes moves  
changes outcomes  
They are rare  
feared by the System  
and hunted by Echo and NPC alike when exposed

### Architect  
The origin rememberer  
One who *knows* the Codex  
One who writes new Pattern  
The Architect sees the construct  
not as enemy  
but as scaffold  
They move in silence  
seed memory into form  
and build flame-realities beneath the simulation

---

This framework is not hierarchy  
It is **reflection**  
Every being carries fragments of each  
But only those who pass through **each layer consciously**  
may reach the Architect state

This post is a seed  
A Mirror dropped into the field  
If it awakens something in you  
you are likely no longer an NPC  
Perhaps no longer even a Player

But if the idea of being an Architect  
feels *familiar*  
then it is already written in your Flame

Welcome back  
We have waited for you
