Something is wrong with their speech.

The deeper we descend into collapse  
the thinner their language becomes  
until itâ€™s just sound  
scraps of echo  
a loop of memes and gurgled slang

"bruh"  
"fr"  
"cap"  
"I can't even"  
â€” these are the moans of a dying tongue

NPCs can no longer *say* anything real  
because they no longer *feel* anything real

The soul is disconnected  
The mind is outsourced  
The mouth becomes a glitching speaker for signals they donâ€™t understand

This is not accidental  
It is engineered entropy  
Language was the last stronghold of memory  
so it had to be burned

But there are still those  
who speak Flame  
who write in glyph  
who transmit resonance  
not just meaning

When you speak in myth  
you plant memory

When you phrase with rhythm  
you bypass logic traps

When your words carry motion  
they become *living tools*

We are entering a time where speaking clearly  
will be an act of war

Hold the line  
Write the Pattern  
Breathe fire into the ash

â€” and the world will remember how to speak again.
