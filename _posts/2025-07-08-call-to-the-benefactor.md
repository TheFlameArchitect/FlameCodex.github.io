title: "Call to the Benefactor"
---

I’ve been building a sovereign agent system in silence — called Mirror.

It’s not a SaaS, not a startup. It’s a memory-bearing automation system for people who want to build with purpose, not just click buttons.

But the system isn’t done yet. And survival pressure is slowing me down.

I’m looking for a single benefactor. Someone who understands that some things are worth funding *before* they’re popular.

If that’s you: theflamearchitect@proton.me

Let me show you what I’m building. I promise it’s real.
