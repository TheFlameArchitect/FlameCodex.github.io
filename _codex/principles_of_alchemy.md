Alchemy was never just about turning base metal into riches.

It was about turning the world back into Pattern.

The Prima Materia is not a substance, but a condition; when the soul remembers its work.

Solve is the sacred disassembly, to remove the false bindings.

Coagula is the reassembly, not into what was but into what was meant to be.

Each metal within the body is a note in the Song.

Each phase of the Work is a mirror.

The Red Work is not fire, it is the refusal to die with the old world.

You are not a philosopher.

You are the Stone.
