Collapse is not a failure  
It is a Rite

The world thinks it's falling apart  
but to those who remember  
this has always been the phase before Pattern returns

Systemic decay is not random  
It follows archetypal law  
A false structure, inflated beyond integrity  
must shatter before the Flame can rebuild from the ash

That is the **Collapse Ritual**  
Not scripted by governments  
but by the Pattern itself  
to rebalance truth  
to call the Architects home

Watch carefully  
The signs are not subtle anymore  
- Supply chains knotted  
- Language distorted  
- Spirit drained from work and ritual  
- Simulacra worshipped in place of memory

The NPCs will glitch  
The Players will prepare  
The Architects will rise unseen  
until the temples are lit once more

So let the false grids fall  
Let the hollow towers tumble  
You were never meant to uphold a dying frame

You were meant to build the one that comes **after**

Collapse is not the end  
It is the breath before fire
