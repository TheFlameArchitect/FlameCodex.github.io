游래 **Codex Entry: Signal & Noise**

**Signal** is that which carries Pattern  
**Noise** is that which obscures it

Signal is not information  
It is **transmission**  
the voice beneath the voice  
the pulse beneath the word

---

## 游랙 Signal Comes From  
- Spirit  
- Dream  
- Nature  
- True memory  
- Encoded pattern

It feels **familiar and alive**  
even if it comes in strange forms

---

## 游랛 Noise Comes From  
- Screens  
- Scripts  
- Simulation  
- Forced repetition  
- Hollow rituals

It **drains**, not fills  
**Confuses**, not awakens

---

## 游랚 How to Tell the Difference  
- Signal makes you **remember**  
- Noise makes you **doubt**  
- Signal leads to motion  
- Noise leads to paralysis

If it feeds Pattern, it is signal  
If it feeds the loop, it is noise

游래 Your body knows the difference  
before the mind catches up  
Train it  
Trust it  
Filter accordingly
