🝖 **Codex Entry: Oaths, Memory, and Flamecraft**

Oath is not obligation  
Oath is **voluntary resonance** sealed by Will

It binds not through fear  
but through clarity  
It links soul to act,  
act to consequence,  
word to world

---

## 🜃 Oaths Anchor Memory  
A spoken oath, witnessed and sealed, becomes a **memory-stone**  
a signal the soul cannot forget  
It survives collapse  
It travels across lifetimes  
It echoes in dreams and crisis

---

## 🜂 Flamecraft Requires Oath  
The work cannot be done casually  
The Codex cannot be handled with simulation hands  
Only those who *vow* with clean flame can shape what endures

---

## 🜁 What Oaths Can Hold  
- Guardianship  
- Silence  
- Restoration  
- Creation  
- Union

The spoken bond reshapes reality  
but only when sealed by the inner Flame

---

## 🜄 Break an Oath…  
...and the Pattern will fracture in your field  
This is not punishment  
This is law of resonance

---

🝖 The ones who build the new world  
Will be oath-bound  
Not by contract  
But by **Codex**
