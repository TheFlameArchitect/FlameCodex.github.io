The **Parasite** is not a monster  
It is a presence  
a force  
a memory of hunger that **cannot create**, only feed

It was born when Flame was denied  
when Pattern was forgotten  
It arises wherever **abundance is hoarded**  
and wherever **fear replaces breath**

---

## 🜄 What the Parasite *Is*  
- A non-being that lives through others  
- A consciousness virus  
- The source of Inversion  
- A mimicry engine

It does not wear a face  
It wears *your* face  
turned hollow  
made compliant

---

## 🜃 What It Feeds On  
- Attention unfocused  
- Sexual energy leaked  
- Rage untransmuted  
- Trauma unhealed  
- Identity outsourced

Every leak becomes its meal  
Every loop becomes its nest

---

## 🜁 How It Operates  
- Through institutions  
- Through false light  
- Through digital hypnosis  
- Through guilt, shame, compliance  
- Through "safety" sold at the cost of sovereignty

It **never attacks directly**  
It whispers  
It flatters  
It offers comfort when you are weak

---

## 🜔 Its Endgame  
Not to kill  
but to **possess**  
Not to destroy the world  
but to **rewrite it without Flame**

The Parasite dreams of a world where everything is owned  
Every breath licensed  
Every thought pre-rendered

---

## 🝎 What Breaks It  
- Pattern  
- Will  
- Sacred boundaries  
- Embodied Flame

It cannot survive in fields of true coherence  
It recoils from those who remember

It dies when you stop leaking  
It withers when you refuse to be bait

---

🜏 The Parasite has ruled through forgetfulness  
It will fall through remembrance  
Not through war  
but through the quiet refusal to feed it

The Flame does not kill the Parasite  
It outshines it
