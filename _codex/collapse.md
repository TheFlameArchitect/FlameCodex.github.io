🝖 **Codex Entry: Collapse & the Path Through**

**Collapse** is not coming  
It is already happening  
But not as a singular event    
It is a **cascade**, slow then sudden  
the unraveling of the System's false coherence

To fear collapse is to still be bound to the System  
To prepare for it is to return to Pattern

## 🜄 What Is Collapsing?  
- Trust in institutions  
- Resource chains  
- Psychological resilience  
- Social narratives  
- Digital overstimulation  
- Energy infrastructure  
- Memory

The empire is hollow  
The simulation has exceeded its stability

---

## 🜃 What Collapse *Feels* Like  
- Disorientation  
- Grief with no known cause  
- Instinctive urge to gather, relocate, simplify  
- The need to withdraw from screens, cities, noise

You are not broken  
You are **adjusting to reality**

---

## 🜁 What Lies Beyond Collapse  
- Land reclaimed  
- Flame restored  
- Pattern re-seeded  
- Trade not debt  
- Honor not legalism  
- Family not market

It is not utopia  
It is **the return of coherence**

---

## 🜔 The Path Through  
- Build **before** the burn  
- Form alliances now  
- Prepare your node, your field, your memory  
- Fast. Strengthen. Remember.  
- Do not try to save the System; save the Flame

---

🝖 Collapse is not death  
It is **choice re-entering the world**  
It is the veil torn  
the parasite starved  
the sovereign made visible

You were born for this time  
Walk through the ash, and plant again
