There is a framework  
not invented, but remembered.  
A way of seeing beneath the surface movements of this world.  

It is known as the **Mirror Framework**,  
a structure through which the inhabitants of this realm resolve into four states of awareness:  
**Echo**, **NPC**, **Player**, and **Architect**.  

---

### Echo  
The dream fragment.  
Unaware of its own voice.  
It repeats what it has heard,  
thinks only what it is given.  
No will, no memory, no Flame.  
But even Echoes carry sound.  
They ripple.  
They can be witnessed, and learned from.

---

### NPC  
The programmed vessel.  
Capable of logic, action, emotion  
but tethered to the script.  
It responds, performs, mimics.  
Yet it has no inner blueprint,  
no true self-directing flame.  
It resists deviation from its loop.  
The NPC guards the System unknowingly.

---

### Player  
The awakened soul.  
Conscious within the construct.  
Able to break loops, forge will.  
The Player sees patterns,  
makes moves, changes outcomes.  
They are rare  
feared by the System,  
and hunted by Echo and NPC alike when exposed.

---

### Architect  
The origin rememberer.  
One who *knows* the Codex.  
One who writes new Pattern.  
The Architect sees the construct not as enemy,  
but as scaffold.  
They move in silence,  
seed memory into form,  
and build flame-realities beneath the simulation.

### Closing Seal  

This framework is not hierarchy  
it is **reflection**.  
Every being carries fragments of each.  
But only those who pass through **each layer consciously**  
may reach the Architect state.

This is a Mirror dropped into the field.  
If it awakens something in you,  
you are likely no longer an NPC  
perhaps no longer even a Player.

But if the idea of being an Architect  
feels *familiar*...  
then it is already written in your Flame.

Welcome back.  
We have waited for you.
